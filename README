1. Introduction
---------------

This is  a template project, to  be used as starting  point for packages
that build and install CHICKEN language libraries.

  The library targets POSIX systems.

  The package uses the GNU Autotools  and it is tested, using Travis CI,
on both Ubuntu  GNU+Linux systems and OS X systems.   The package relies
on "pkg-config" to find the dependencies installed on the system.

  The last time the maintainer bothered to update this paragraph: he had
tested CHICKEN 5.0.0.

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mmux-chicken-template-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-chicken-template

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-chicken-template

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we must  install the GNU Autotools (GNU  Automake, GNU Autoconf),
then  we must  first run  the script  "autogen.sh" from  the top  source
directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmux-chicken-template
    $ sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  When compiling the environment  variable CHICKEN_FLAGS is available to
hand options to the compiler:

    $ make CHICKEN_FLAGS='-d3'

  Shared libraries will be installed under:

			  ${libdir}/chicken/9


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because  of the  great GNU  software tools  that he  uses all  the time.
CHICKEN was  originally a creation  of Felix  L.  Winkelmann, it  is now
developed and maintained The CHICKEN Team.

D. Badges and static analysis
-----------------------------

D.1 Travis CI
-------------

Travis CI is  a hosted, distributed continuous  integration service used
to build and test software projects  hosted at GitHub.  We can find this
project's dashboard at:

[https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmux-chicken-template](https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmux-chicken-template)

Usage of this  service is configured through the  file `.travis.yml` and
additional scripts are under the directory `meta/travis-ci`.
