# MMCK Template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmck-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmck-template)

## Introduction

This is  a template project, to  be used as starting  point for packages
that  build  and  install  CHICKEN language  libraries.   CHICKEN  is  a
Scheme-to-C compiler supporting the language  features as defined in the
``Revised^5 Report on Scheme''.

The  library targets  POSIX systems.   To  run the  tests: this  package
depends upon the package MMCK Checks.

The package uses the GNU Autotools and it is tested, using Travis CI, on
both Ubuntu GNU+Linux  systems and OS X systems.

This package  should work  with CHICKEN  version 5+;  the last  time the
maintainer  bothered to  update this  paragraph: he  had tested  CHICKEN
5.1.0.

## Install

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

```
$ cd mmck-template-0.1.0
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install
```

to inspect the available configuration options:

```
$ ../configure --help
```

The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

```
$ make -j4 all && make -j4 check
```

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

The Makefile supports the DESTDIR  environment variable to install files
in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

```
$ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmck-template
```

to really do it:

```
$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmck-template
```

After the  installation it is  possible to verify the  installed library
against the test suite with:

```
$ make installcheck
```

From a repository checkout or snapshot  (the ones from the Github site):
we  must install  the GNU  Autotools  (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,  GNU
Libtool), then  we must first run  the script `autogen.sh` from  the top
source directory, to generate the needed files:

```
$ cd mmck-template
$ sh autogen.sh

```

After this  the procedure  is the same  as the one  for building  from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

```
$ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
$ make
$ make check
$ make install
```

When compiling  the environment  variable CHICKEN_FLAGS is  available to
hand options to the compiler:

```
$ make CHICKEN_FLAGS='-d3'
```

Shared libraries will be installed under:

```
${libdir}/chicken/9
```

## Usage

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

```
$ make html
$ make install-html
```

## Credits

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because  of the  great GNU  software tools  that he  uses all  the time.
CHICKEN was  originally a creation  of Felix  L.  Winkelmann, it  is now
developed and maintained The CHICKEN Team.
